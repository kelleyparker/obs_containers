1) Multistreaming
   Intended to be a replacement for Restream.io.  Restream allows only two RTMP feeds for free.  Paid option is required for more than 2 (5+), about $20 USD/mont has of November 1, 2023.  I find that unacceptable.  This container I create just needs to be run AFTER configuring the nginx.conf file with the necessary RTMP URLs and stream keys and bitrates
    Kick.com's bitrate needs to be around 3 Mbps as I see that anything much higher than that ends up in the stream cutting out.
